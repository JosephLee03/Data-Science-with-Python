- âš¡ Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other frameworks have made machine learning and deep learning modeling more accessible.

- ðŸ’” However, for beginners, using these frameworks often makes it difficult to deepen their understanding of the models.

- ðŸ’¡ This project implements a series of common algorithms using Numpy, serving both as a record of the author's daily learning and as a reference for beginners in the field. 

- ðŸ“• The author is also a beginner and mistakes are inevitable.Feedback and discussions are welcome! ðŸŒ¼



## 1. BP Neural Network

- 2023/12/15: The final version of Artificial Neural Network ([ANN](myANN.py)) has been uploaded. It implements a BP neural network based on numpy and provides test cases. Furthermore, matrix-vector multiplication was used for optimization in sections involving multiple loops, effectively reducing the time complexity.
- Run [myANN.py](myANN.py) directly, you can see the test results as shown in the following figure.
