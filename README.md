- 🔥 Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other frameworks have made machine learning and deep learning modeling more accessible.

- 💧 However, for beginners, using these frameworks often makes it difficult to deepen their understanding of the models.

- 💡 This project implements a series of common algorithms using Numpy, serving both as a record of the author's daily learning and as a reference for beginners in the field.

- 🙂 The author is also a beginner and mistakes are inevitable.Feedback and discussions are welcome!
